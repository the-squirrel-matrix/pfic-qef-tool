# Beginning Lots Template for PFIC QEF Tool
# ------------------------------------------
# lot_id: Unique identifier for this lot (e.g., LOT-001, LOT-002)
# ticker: Fund ticker symbol (must match config, e.g., XEQT, VEQT)
# purchase_date: Date purchased in YYYY-MM-DD format (preferred, other formats accepted)
# quantity: Number of shares/units in this lot (up to 4 decimal places)
# cost_basis_usd: Total cost basis in USD (purchase price + fees, already in USD)
# original_lot_id: (optional) If this lot was split from another, the original lot ID
#
# NOTES:
# - These are lots you held at the START of the tax year (from prior years)
# - Lots purchased during the tax year should go in transactions.csv, not here
# - Cost basis should already include any prior year QEF adjustments
# - The tool accepts both .csv and .json formats for lot files
#
# Example entries (delete these and add your own):
